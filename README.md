XML File Transfer
===
The student will create an application that inspects a directory, reads in the contents of a file, uses JAXB to create an XML document for that file which contains a username (the name of the student), the date in yyyy-MM-dd format, the filename, and the contents of the file itself (embedded in a CDATA tag). The application will then open a Socket, write that XML document to that Socket, and then close the Socket. The application will repeat this process for each file in the designated directory.

The student will then create an application that hosts a ServerSocket that listens for incoming connections. When a connection is received, it will spawn a client handler thread to interact with the client and then return to listening for new connections. The client handler thread will read an XML document from the connection. The XML document will contain a username, a date, a filename, and the contents of the file (embedded in a CDATA tag). The application will first create a directory for the username if it does not already exist. The application will then create a subdirectory for the date if it does not already exist. Finally, the application will recreate the file in that directory.
